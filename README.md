# Maze Game
Play randomly generated mazes in your terminal! 

Note that currently generating mazes is not supported (that will come in the future) - right now it just generates a bunch of random walls. 

Invoke with `java -jar MazeGame-0.0.jar <SIZE>` for the size (note each "cell" takes up 2 characters horizontally), or pass no size to use the default 40. You are the `` looking for the `┣┫`. WASD to move, Q to quit. Note that it might not work properly on Windows.
